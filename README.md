⚙️ Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
```
Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the web application:
```
python app.py
The app will usually be accessible at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
🧪 How to Use the Web App
