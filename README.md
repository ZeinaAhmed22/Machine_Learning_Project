⚙️ Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure requirements.txt includes packages like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, flask, etc.

Run the web application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The app will usually be accessible at:
